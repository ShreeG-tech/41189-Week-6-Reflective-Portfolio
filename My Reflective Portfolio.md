# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio
## Week 6
### What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about many-model thinking, which is comprised of the Markhov, Random walk and Broadcast, Diffusion, and Contagion Models, and how they all contribute to complex systems evolving, to the latter models’ representation of the spread of ideas, information, technologies, behaviours, diseases. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week’s learning’s taught me a lot about how to differentiate between all sorts of models. The Markov model is the evolution of systems that have defined states. Random Walks models, comprise of parties, companies, and the stock market. Broadcast models; display the spreading of information/ideas from centralised sources. Diffusion models, portray the spreading of information/ideas within a population. Finally, Contagion models, showcase the disease/idea spreading within a population + recovery, very relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic we’re living in currently.

The underlying assumptions of Markov processes are: 
1. Finite, limited quantity of states 
2. Fixed, same transition probabilities 
3. Can gradually journey from any state to another. Perhaps not immediately, however, there should be some way of transitioning between any 2 states. 
4. It is not simple, e.g. it cannot periodically cycle between 2-3 states.

If these four conditions are fulfilled – that is one unique equilibrium.
Implications: 
- The starting conditions don’t matter 
- History doesn’t matter 
- Coming in the way to change states won’t work 
- Temporary change if the transition probabilities remain same

Random Walk models are all about decision making, specifically concerning the probability and quality of the said decisions’ correctness. It looks at their speed, their size or scope, and of course, the implications that decisions come with. We all know that making correct decisions matters a lot more than making decisions quickly. Thus, taking the time to think things through and make the correct decision is overall more beneficial than making more decisions in an impulsive manner. Large decisions have an exceptionally large influence on our results, without sacrificing the precision it takes. If we think of precision as a substitute for risk, then making fewer, but more important decisions, will then lead to better outcomes. Conjoining these, to increase performance it is highly imperative to get massive-impact decisions correct, but low-impact decisions could be a bit insignificant. There is  a lot of value in being able to identify which decisions are most likely to have the highest impact, and thus be able to spend time focusing on making the correct decision, as they are significant. We can become better decision makers by:
1. Rapidly identifying which decisions are the most important to make and focus on them and delegate the best decision-maker, which can most of the time be yourself
2. Small decisions that may be fast to make are good candidates to delegate to people like family and friends, the internet etc.
3. Small decisions that take a long time should be captured and then forgotten if no solution arises. You don’t have forever to dwell upon it, but it depends on how “small” the decision is, as small can be subjective. 
4. Time-box the decision-making process to avoid wasting time on making trivial improvements in decision outcome. Do not procrastinate on bigger decisions, as they should be your focal point. 

The broadcast model gets the dissemination of ideas, rumours, information, or technologies through media like television, radio, or the internet. Knowledge of the most current events spreads through broadcast, which is why we are able to know about them, as we have the media to access them. The number of informed people in a given time period, like our contemporary times = the number of informed people in the previous time period + the probability that a susceptible person hears of the information x by the quantity of susceptible people. 

### What insights have I gained?
The insights I gained from this week’s content are that Markhov models are more flexible, as they can be applied to many situations, they are simple to put into effect, so no memorisation is required, the probabilities apply to all system collaborators (segments), and transition probabilities are consistent in the long run. Even though the SIR model was designed initially to examine the spread of diseases, we can now apply it to social phenomena that spread by diffusion and then faded away: books, songs, dance steps, phrases, websites, diets, and exercise regimens. Which were fads, and what lasted the long run? We can estimate the probabilities of contact, spread, and recovery and basic reproduction numbers in these non-disease contexts as well. The model surmises that the small changes in these probabilities could state the difference between success and failure by increasing the reproduction to be >0. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
For me, my perceived strengths are that I am quite adept at verbal/linguistic and intrapersonal learning.  However, my weaknesses are that I am not good at learning in the logical/mathematical, naturalist, kinaesthetic, and musical/rhythmic. 

### What were the challenges I encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenges I observed this week are that there are so many models to comprehend, and different models will work for different situations. I and my team looked at the issue we’re considering doing, and looking at what models have been used to represent such issue in the past, and how they can be adapted to our current times.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time is to really study the major issues affecting our world today, and observe how they’ve been modelled in the past, and how these models and more, can be adapted to contemporary times. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory I feel that has proved to be most useful for this week is the Condorcet’s jury theorem, which is a political science theorem, that looks at the relative probability of a given group of individuals coming to a correct decision, I find this is more than relevant than ever in today’s complex political and legal system, especially in the USA, which me and my team are considering doing for our pre-submission and the subsequent many model thinking assignment. The Condorcet jury theorem provides a theoretical basis for democracy.

Unfortunately, the theorem holds water only under the unrealistic assumption that votes are independent. With the aid of a simple discrete probability model, the Condorcet Jury Theorem is goes further beyond to situations where there is a dependency between judgements. A Condorcet Jury Theorem is related to an election as aforementioned, in which the agents-the people involved, which would be the country’s citizens, have common preferences but diverse information, strongly suggesting that the outcome is better, on average, than the one that would be chosen by any specific individual. 

This would perhaps explain a lot of people grouping together to either vote Blue for Democrat, or Red for Republican, and living in such states that practice the way they vote. At times, there is the additional assertion that, as the population increases, the probability of an incorrect decision goes to 0, but can the opposite be true as well, as the population grows, wouldn’t there be more incorrect decisions? As people have different levels of education, and therefore different ways of getting their information. This would all contribute towards diversity of thought.
